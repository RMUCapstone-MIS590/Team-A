# GITHUB LABELS AND MILESTONES

## MILESTONES

We decided there was only a couple things we actually wanted to track:

- What are we doing right now?
- What aren’t we doing right now?
- What aren’t we sure about?


## How it works

- items are reported as **issues**
- points and meta data are assigned to items as **labels**
- **milestones** are used to group issues in sprints

## 1. Create issues as backlog items

To create a new backlog item, just create a new issue.

Once a new issue has been created, assign it the right labels and/or assign it to a sprint (milestone).

Issues allow you to have a conversation about the item and even allow you to create task lists inside the issue using [GitHub's markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## 2. Add labels to issues

Add the following labels to your repository:

### Priorities

`priority` labels allow you to prioritize items in your backlog e.g.:

- `priority: lowest`
- `priority: low`
- `priority: medium`
- `priority: high`
- `priority: highest`

### Time

**Highest** = Within 24 Hours

**High** = Within 72 hours

**Medium** = Within 96 Hours

**Low** = Within 7 Days

**Lowest** = When time allows

### Points

`point` labels allow you to to assign velocity points to individual items (issues) e.g. using [Fibonacci numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number):

- `point: 1`
- `point: 2`
- `point: 3`
- `point: 5`
- `point: 8`
- `point: 13`
- `point: 21`

### Types

`type` labels allow you to easily filter items (issues) in the dashboard e.g.:

- `type:bug`: bug
- `type:chore`: chore, maintenance work
- `type:feature`: new feature
- `type:infrastructure`: infrastructure related
- `type:performance`: performance related
- `type:refactor`: refactor
- `type:test`: test related

### Other

You can define and assign custom labels that you need within your workflow or organization.

## 3. Define sprints as milestones

You can create a milestone for every sprint and add items (issues) from the backlog to a milestone.

This allows you to group items in sprints and track them by milestone in your [issue dashboard](https://github.com/issues).

The backlog then consists of all items (issues) that have no `milestone` attached to it.

**TIP**: Use `no:milestone` in the search field on your [issue dashboard](https://github.com/issues) to find backlog items.
