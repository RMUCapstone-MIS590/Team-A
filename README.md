# GITHUB LABELS AND MILESTONES

## MILESTONES

We decided there was only a couple things we actually wanted to track:

- What are we doing right now?
- What aren’t we doing right now?
- What aren’t we sure about?


## LABELS

GitHub Issues has a slim set of features:

- Issues, of course
- Issues can be assigned
- Issues belong to zero or one milestone
- Issues can have any number of tags


`BUG` - The issue documents broken, incorrect, or confusing behavior.

`DISCUSSION` -

`DUPLICATE` -

`ENHANCEMENT` - 

`FEATURE` - 

`HELP WANTED` -
